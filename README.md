# How to Load

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to load and configure the necessary tools for intercepting and auto-replying HTTP requests.

## Step 1: Download HTTP Debugger and Create New Rule for Auto Reply

1. Download and install an HTTP debugging tool such as [HTTP Debugger](https://www.httpdebugger.com/) or a similar proxy like Fiddler or Charles.

2. Launch the tool and navigate to the rules or auto-response section.

3. Create a new rule for auto-reply:
   - Set the condition (e.g., URL pattern matching your target endpoint).
   - Define the response (e.g., custom JSON or status code).
   - Enable the rule.

For a visual guide, see the screenshot below:

> **Note:** Ensure the tool is running as an administrator if dealing with HTTPS traffic. Import any necessary certificates for secure connections.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 2: Configure your application to route traffic through the debugger.
- Test the setup by sending a request and verifying the auto-reply.

If you encounter issues, check the tool's documentation or troubleshooting section.
